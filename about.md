## About Me

I'm a rising senior at Brown University, studying physics and am a candidate in the Undergraduate Teacher Education Program (UTEP), an undergraduate track for teacher licensure offered by Brown's education department. In May 2018, I will be graduating, and will hopefully start as a high school teacher in Fall 2018.

I am a native of Warrenville, a small town about an hour outside of Chicago, right next to Fermilab. I went to Wheaton Warrenville South High School, graduating in 2014.

### Extra-curriculars

At Brown, in addition to studying physics and my candidacy in UTEP, I researched in gravitational lensing in [Ian Dell'Antonio's lab](http://www.het.brown.edu/people/ian/astro/Group_Page/Home.html) for two semesters, have been involved in various editorial and writing roles for the Brown Political Review, and have been in the Brown Democrats, serving as treasurer and vice president.

### Work Experience

My work experience spans the past five years, in various education and camp counselor roles. I started as a camp counselor for the Warrenville Park District's day camp for three summers, working as a supervisor for the last two. During Summer 2016, I worked as a Residential Counselor at the Stanford Pre-Collegiate Summer Institutes, serving as a camp counselor and TA. During my sophomore, junior, and senior years, I have worked as a grader in the Math Department, grading (at various points) Calculus I, II, and III, and Linear Algebra. And during junior spring and this fall, I have worked as a tutor for the Dean of the College, tutoring the introduction physics classes.
